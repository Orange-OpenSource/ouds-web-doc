Our utility API is based on a series of Sass maps and functions for generating families of classes with various options. If you’re unfamiliar with Sass maps, read up on the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps/">official Sass docs</a> to get started.</p>
<p>The <code>$utilities</code> map contains all our utilities and is later merged with your custom <code>$utilities</code> map, if present. The utility map contains a keyed list of utility groups which accept the following options:</p>
<div class="table-responsive">

<p>All utilities generated by the API include <code>!important</code> to ensure they override components and modifier classes as intended. You can toggle this setting globally with the <code>$enable-important-utilities</code> variable (defaults to <code>true</code>).</p>

<p>New utilities can be added to the default <code>$utilities</code> map with a <code>map-merge</code>. Make sure our required Sass files and <code>_utilities.scss</code> are imported first, then use the <code>map-merge</code> to add your additional utilities. For example, here’s how to add a responsive <code>cursor</code> utility with three values.</p>

<p>Modify existing utilities in the default <code>$utilities</code> map with <code>map-get</code> and <code>map-merge</code> functions. In the example below, we’re adding an additional value to the <code>width</code> utilities. Start with an initial <code>map-merge</code> and then specify which utility you want to modify. From there, fetch the nested <code>&quot;width&quot;</code> map with <code>map-get</code> to access and modify the utility’s options and values.</p>
