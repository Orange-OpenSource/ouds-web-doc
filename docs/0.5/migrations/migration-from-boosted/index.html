<p>Let’s start with the most obvious change you’ll notice: the name. <strong>Boosted is now OUDS Web.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The NPM package is now <code>@ouds/web</code>.</li>
<li>The CSS and JS files have been renamed:
<ul>
<li><code>boosted-grid.css</code> → <code>ouds-web-grid.css</code></li>
<li><code>boosted-grid.min.css</code> → <code>ouds-web-grid.min.css</code></li>
<li><code>boosted-reboot.css</code> → <code>ouds-web-reboot.css</code></li>
<li><code>boosted-reboot.min.css</code> → <code>ouds-web-reboot.min.css</code></li>
<li><code>boosted-utilities.css</code> → <code>ouds-web-utilities.css</code></li>
<li><code>boosted-utilities.min.css</code> → <code>ouds-web-utilities.min.css</code></li>
<li><code>boosted.css</code> → <code>ouds-web.css</code></li>
<li><code>boosted.min.css</code> → <code>ouds-web.min.css</code></li>
<li><code>boosted.bundle.js</code> → <code>ouds-web.bundle.js</code></li>
<li><code>boosted.bundle.min.js</code> → <code>ouds-web.bundle.min.js</code></li>
<li><code>boosted.esm.js</code> → <code>ouds-web.esm.js</code></li>
<li><code>boosted.esm.min.js</code> → <code>ouds-web.esm.min.js</code></li>
<li><code>boosted.js</code> → <code>ouds-web.js</code></li>
<li><code>boosted.min.js</code> → <code>ouds-web.min.js</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From now on, OUDS Web won’t embed Bootstrap elements that are not part of Orange Unified Design System. However, you can still use our Bootstrap compatibility mode by using <code>ouds-web-bootstrap.css</code> and <code>ouds-web-bootstrap.min.css</code>.</p>

<p><span class="badge text-bg-status-warning-emphasized">Warning</span> Orange color has been modified from <code>#f16e00</code> to <code>#f15e00</code>. It means that under certain circumstances, you might be able to use Orange and light gray items together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="badge text-bg-status-positive-emphasized">New</span> We provide two brand new themes that are <code>root</code> and <code>root-inverted</code>.

<p>OUDS Web doesn’t use the Helvetica Neue font. Instead, it uses the system font stack. This means that the font will be slightly different depending on the operating system and browser being used.</p>
<p>Technically, it means that you can get rid of the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helvetica Neue woff2 files: <code>fonts/HelvNeue55_W1G.woff2</code>, <code>fonts/HelvNeue75_W1G.woff2</code>, <code>fonts/HelveticaNeueW20-55Roman.woff2</code>, and <code>fonts/HelveticaNeueW20-75Bold.woff2</code>.</li>
<li><code>orange-helvetica.*.css</code> file (default, RTL, or minified version).</li>
<li>If you were customizing your Sass compilation, you can remove the <code>@import &quot;orange-helvetica&quot;;</code> line from your Sass files if it was there.</li>

<p><span class="badge text-bg-status-positive-emphasized">New</span> The mixin <code>get-font-size({font-size-ref})</code> has been added, where <code>font-size-ref</code> is one of: <code>&quot;code-medium&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;label-small&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;label-medium&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;label-large&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;label-xlarge&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;body-small&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;body-medium&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;body-large&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;heading-small&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;heading-medium&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;heading-large&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;heading-xlarge&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;display-small&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;display-medium&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;display-large&quot;</code>.

<p><span class="badge text-bg-status-warning-emphasized">Warning</span> <code>color-mode({mode}, {root}, {inverted-mode})</code> mixin signature has changed. We now provide an <code>$inverted-mode</code> parameter that is set by default to <code>light</code> or <code>dark</code> depending on the <code>$mode</code>. It allows you to precise another mode to be the inverse of a certain mode.</p>

<p><span class="badge text-bg-status-warning-emphasized">Warning</span> <code>button-variant</code> mixin signature has changed. We now provide extra parameters for focus and loading states colors.
